[Live site can be viewed here](https://j0hn1975.github.io/CI-MS1-Reef/)

## Overview

## Scope

## User Stories

As a new fan of the band I would like to see:

> 1.  A site that is easy and clear to navigate
> 2.  A biography of the band
> 3.  A brief history of all the band members
> 4.  Old songs from the band
> 5.  An error page to show if I have entered an incorrect URL

As an existing fan of the band I would like to see:

> 8.  Picture and videos of the band
> 9.  A bookings page where I can book the band for my events

## Site owner goals

The main goal of this site is to present useful information about the band on a website that is easy to navigate.

> 12. Present the end-user with a clear and simple navigation menu
> 13. A button on the 404 page that takes the user back to the Home page

---

## Structure

The website has been structured with 5 web pages (including a 404 error page). Each page is clearly designed, easy to navigate, and with well-laid out information. With a mobile-first approach in mind, I have used bootstrap throughout to make the site responsive on mobile devices.

> The 4 pages are:
>
> 1. Home Page: A carousel with 3 large clear images of the band, a brief history of the band and intro to the band members, new tour dates announced section, the latest video displayed, a new music section, classic Reef songs from the back catalogue.
> 2. Bio Page: A large clear image of the band is displayed along with a more detailed biography of the band and how they all first met and came to form Reef.
> 3. Media Page: A page that has a single column of 3 videos displayed and pictures laid out in masonry format.
> 4. Bookings Page: A background image of the bass player with a contact form overlayed.
> 5. 404: This alerts users if they have entered an incorrect URL for the site. The user is presented with a warning message, navbar, footer, and button to back to Home Page.

## Skeleton

To design and develop the wireframes I first used Balsamiq, then used Snipping Tools to create PNG versions. The wireframes images are designed to collapse.

## Surface

## Colours

Each page is designed with very simple colours and images to showcase the island. The colours I have used are as follows:

> - #CFE1FD - used for nav link and brand hover colour
> - #88B6FC - use for nav link and brand text colour
> - #000000 - used nav bar and footer background, card text, button text, band biography, video card text.
> - #009688 - used to style the quiz text.
> - #1DA1F2 - for Twitter social icon
> - #c5ecfd - for contact form input fields
> - Green - for Spotify social icon
> - Red - for social YouTube icon

## Typography

Throughout the site, I have used 3 Google Fonts chosen for their modern, but clean look and readability.
All fonts below will fall back to Sans-Serif if Google Font cannot be read by the browser.

Nav links, navbar brand, h1 main-headings (Home and Bio page).

> - [RocknRoll+One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/RocknRoll+One?query=RocknRoll+One)

Subheading (Home Page), h6 card headings, card title and text, p tags in video cards.

> - [Anton](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Anton?query=Anton)

Band Intro

> - [Antonio](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Antonio?query=Antonio)

## Imagery

Throughout the site I have used large pictures of the band.

## Design

> The site is made up of 5 pages (including an error 404 page). I have used large, clear images of the band mostly in a live setting to give a visual reprenstation of the band's rock music style.
